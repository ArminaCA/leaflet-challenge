This project entails a dynamic web application leveraging the Leaflet JavaScript library, designed to present real-time earthquake data sourced from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in an engaging manner. The application seamlessly retrieves earthquake data in GeoJSON format through the USGS API and translates it into an interactive map display. Notably, each earthquake occurrence is symbolized by a circular marker on the map, where the marker's size corresponds to the earthquake's magnitude, while its color signifies the depth of the event. A simple click on a marker unveils a popup providing supplementary details about the specific earthquake, including its location, magnitude, and depth.

To launch the application, merely initiate the index.html file within a web browser. Upon loading, the map will promptly exhibit the most recent earthquake data obtained from the USGS. The map's functionalities encompass zooming in and out, navigating the map's expanse, and engaging with markers to glean insights into individual earthquakes. The foundational map is provided courtesy of OpenStreetMap.
